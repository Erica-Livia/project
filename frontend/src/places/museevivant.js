            The Bujumbura Living Museum is a zoo and museum in Burundi . The museum is located in Bujumbura , the country's largest city and former capital until 2018;
             it is one of two public museums in the country.<br></br>
             The museum was founded on June 18, 1977 and occupies an area of 3â€‹ ha in the vicinity of rue du October 13 in downtown Bujumbura. It is dedicated to the wildlife and art of Burundi 1 .<br></br>
             In December 2016, the zoo's collection included six crocodiles , a monkey , a leopard , two chimpanzees , three guinea fowl , a turtle , an antelope and a number of snakes and fish in an aquarium. 
             A number of Burundian artisans also have workshops on the museum premises. Several different types of trees stand in the park, next to a reconstruction of a traditional Burundian house ( rugo ). <br></br>
             The number of visitors to the museum fell sharply following the Burundian unrest and demonstrations of 2015 , causing a wider drop in the number of tourists in the country
